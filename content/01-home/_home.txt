My artwork is more like a tour of the Louvre on a Harley-- influenced by almost 5 centuries of European art and decades of American experimentation, a hybrid of styles with a deep knowledge of color theory and how to represent ideas through images.

Together with an expert understanding of human anatomy, and a fiery passion for visual articulation and body beautification.

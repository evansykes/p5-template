Text: ###ABOUT SAFE AND BRILLIANT BODY ART:

Whether this is your first or fifteenth tattoo, please carefully read the following information and disclosure.  Tattooing is as widely varied as restaurants or fashion when it comes to quality and regardless of what other artists or friends may have told you in the past, especially about aftercare,  this information is based on experience and the most up-to-date science available.  Please ask questions if you have them!

Tattooing means inserting pigment under the skin, deep enough where it lasts for life.  It hurts,  a whole lot in some places.  Please ask if you have concerns about this, and understand that ***it is absolutely crucial that you brave up, hold extremely still during the entire procedure.*** Unfortunately, both the procedure and the healing process are painful and inconvenient, but art you wear for the rest of your life is a serious decision and should only be done if it’s absolutely worth the price you pay.  Don’t commit to a large piece unless you are sure you can sit like a champ for the entire procedure.  Usually the first 15 minutes are the most uncomfortable,  while your body begins to produce natural dopamines that can reduce the pain during the rest of the procedure.  Your artist is well experienced in this area, and can advise you on breathing and relaxation techniques that can dramatically reduce your stress level during and after the procedure.  Don’t be embarrassed to ask!

Tattooing is a visual language with an enormous vocabulary. There are many ways to say something, and as many visual styles as there are people, and each person has preferences and a style that suits them best. Nothing about tattooing should be standard-issue, and I’m glad to discuss what concepts are best suited to which body parts, which colors suit both your design idea and your skin type, size and flow of the design, etc. There are many, many ways to express what you want to express, and its best to know the options so you’re sure you’ve settled on what truly suits you best. It takes time and thought, but it’s worth it.  The industry is just exploding with creativity right now, and artists are employing the fundamental principles of traditional fine arts more than ever.  My traditional arts and design background span a wide range of media and aesthetic theory, so I have a wide range to draw from.  A tattoo is a huge commitment to yourself that lasts a lifetime, and you can feel totally comfortable discussing any part of it with your artist during the design phase without rushing-- you want to be sure you have the best possible fit for your idea and style, your body and skin type.

Any good licensed tattoo artist takes extreme care to make sure all instruments and procedure areas are thoroughly sterilized before we get started.  We’re trained and certified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and go to great lengths to make sure all procedures are safe for both client and artist. I use only single-use, pre-sterilized instruments because I prefer the absolute cleanliness they offer.  Again, feel free to ask any questions you may have; it’s a topic I have a deep and wide knowledge of, and education is key to avoiding problems!

After we’ve designed and finalized your artwork, the tattooing procedure is simple. Skin is cleaned, shaved, and a stencil of the artwork is applied to the skin and allowed to dry for about 10 minutes.  I’ve got a big mirror for you to check and recheck your design and it’s placement, size, etc. to be sure it’s perfect.

Once your tattoo is finished, it will be very sore, and likely swell a bit-- possibly a lot if it’s in a sensitive area like “the pit” (the inner bend of the elbow) or the inner bicep.  This is normal but requires and deserves attention-- it’s a wound and should be treated that way. It needs to stay clean and protected from infection and any abrasion.  In an ideal world, you’d take time off work as if you were recovering from minor surgery. Skin needs to be kept clean (no fluid collecting on the surface, no contaminants introduced to the open wound) and protected from abrasion of any kind. Don’t cover your tattoo with clothing if at all possible, and don’t go back to a construction job the next day! If you damage your tattoo during the first week of healing, the damage is permanent.

In the first hour or so after tattooing, the skin weeps fluid, which may include blood, plasma (the whitish part of the blood) and ink. This is normal, but must not be allowed to dry on the skin or it will form a thicker and harder scab than you want, which makes for a more painful heal and can ultimately mean the ink gets pulled out of the skin, resulting in a hole in your tattoo. It’s easy to prevent if you show your tattoo a little love. Simply use a damp paper towel, folded into quarters, and ***gently*** dab the are until any puddles on the surface are gone. For larger tattoos in more sensitive areas, this may be required for several days after the tattoo, especially after showering. Take the time and show the love, it pays off with a great heal and bright, clear artwork.

***Use only Bacitracin ointment*** to keep the skin moist for the first 5 days.  A&D doesn’t have the antibiotic you need.  After 5 days you can switch to a super rich lotion like Eucerine, jojoba oil, etc. and apply as often as you like. Don’t be cheap- buy something a hippie would use. Your skin and art are worth the investment. Cheap lotions have alcohol in them and will sting like crazy on a healing tattoo.

Other than the necessary dabbing of weeping fluids, please, please, please DO NOT TOUCH YOUR TATTOO while it heals!! Touching introduces bacteria, disrupts the fragile healing skin, and yes, ***you need that scab to stay put until it falls off on it’s own*** Even if it itches or pulls or hurts, keep the skin pliable with plenty of rich lotion. Pulling or picking off scabs can ruin your tattoo, seriously. Be patient.

Swelling can be iced for faster healing and pain relief.  Use a cold compress wrapped in soft fabric, and ice as long and often as you want, but be very careful to make sure the fabric doesn’t adhere to the wound by leaving it in place too long! If fabric accidentally adheres to the wound, either clothing or sheets, etc., saturate the fabric with clean cold water and wait until the adhesion softens enough to gently and slowly pull the fabric off the wound area, taking extreme care to not damage the skin/scab.

Ibuprofen and Aleve are fine, even recommended during the first few days of a heal. Follow the manufacturer instructions.

For two weeks, no swimming, hot tubs, or activities like gardening or softball that can scratch your skin or accidentally cause your scabs to be pulled off.  You want to prevent infection and abrasion of any kind.  Sorry, no exercise until all signs of swelling are gone and the wound has fully closed (scabbed over). You don’t want hard circulation or sweating during the first 5 days or so, though very small tattoos may close up after 3 days. Don’t push it, it’s not worth it. The gym is rad but it can wait a few more days; your art is for life.

Your immune system is what heals your tattoo, so be kind to it. The stronger your immune system, the better your heal and your artwork for life. Take a vitamin every day, at the very least. Sleep well and long.  Avoid garbage food.  No alcohol before or after a tattoo. Don’t worry, people get safe and brilliant tattoos all the time and are happy about it for life, as long as they take the right care before, during and after.  Ask as many questions as you want and email or call me with any questions during your heal.
